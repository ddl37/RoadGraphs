                    Note: So now we want to apply this to create a solution on real-world roads (that is, a placement of sensors on edges of the graph) - we decided to use Auckland. 
                    
                    Introducing real-world road conditions makes the problem significantly more challenging.

                    Earlier we gave conditions for obtaining *complete* information. However, that may be too many
                    sensors for NZTA to consider, so we want to scale down the number of sensors while preserving as
                    much information as possible.

                    We use the result on simplification of vertices in a line from earlier, as well as some other techniques (like chuck out useless roads from residential areas)... to transform into right one. 

                    As you can see, significantly fewer edges,

                    Here, we have an example of sensor placements for the entirety of Auckland -- which is not
                    particularly optimal due to limitations in available computational power.

                    As in the earlier diagrams, the color of the road indicates the traffic flow in the "worst case"
                    maximisation scenario.

                    still fairly large amount of uncertainty, basically corresponding to the fact that to obtain
                    "complete" information requires a very large number of sensors.

                    As you can see, this is a lot of sensors, but the sensor number is configurable. Those additional
                    configurations aren't displayed, because making the computer generate all these sensor placements
                    took a very long time.

                    This could be extended into e.g. a tool for NZTA to interactively add sensors and observe the effect
                    on the entire network of traffic flow.
